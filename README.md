# About This [Anvil](https://anvil.works/?utm_source=github:app_README) App

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT:** This app is currently under development. It will fetch a newsletter from your GMail inbox and provide it to AI for analysis. Check back soon to learn more!

## Local Development Setup

To set up the local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Set up Google Cloud Console**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Gmail API for your project
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (OAuth client ID)
   - Add "http://localhost:8080/" as an "Authorized redirect URI" in the OAuth consent screen
   - Download the client configuration file

2. **Configure Local Files**
   - In the `local_tools` directory:
     1. Copy `example_client_secrets.json` to `client_secrets.json`
     2. Replace the contents with your downloaded Google OAuth credentials
     3. Copy `Example_Uplink_Connect.py` to `Uplink_Connect.py`
     4. In `Uplink_Connect.py`, replace `server_H5WIGHRGGOH3REFDRWQV42VW-JEYPSRQHY3WGCTGA` with your Anvil server uplink code
        - You can find this code in your Anvil app settings under "Uplink"

3. **Get Google OAuth Refresh Token**
   - Run the `get_refresh_token.py` script in the `local_tools` directory
   - Follow the browser authentication flow
   - If no refresh token is generated (shows as "None"):
     1. Go to [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
     2. Remove access for this application
     3. Run `get_refresh_token.py` again
   - Save the generated refresh token
   - Add it to your Anvil app's secrets as `google_refresh_token`

4. **Additional Anvil Secrets Required**
   - `google_client_id`: Your Google OAuth client ID
   - `google_client_secret`: Your Google OAuth client secret
   - `sender_email`: Email address of the newsletter sender
   - `openai_api_key`: Your OpenAI API key
